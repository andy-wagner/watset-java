<p>This is an open source implementation of the Watset algorithm for fuzzy graph clustering (aka soft clustering). The
    implementation is multi-threaded, extensible, contains several unit tests, and can be easily embedded into any
    Java-based graph processing pipeline. Also, it offers a convenient command-line tool for running Watset over the
    edge lists in text files.</p>
